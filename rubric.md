## üß© Core Criteria (Product)

| # | Criterion | Weight | Critical? | 1 ‚Äì Poor (Observable Evidence) | 3 ‚Äì Adequate (Observable Evidence) | 5 ‚Äì Excellent (Observable Evidence) |
|---|-----------|--------|-----------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **1** | **Persona Coherence & Authenticity**<br>(depth, voice, role, originality) | **20%** |  | Generic/indistinct; backstory absent; voice drifts; role unclear | Distinct traits + workable backstory appear in outputs; voice mostly steady; role recognizable | Rich backstory, quirks, values; vivid, consistent voice in varied contexts; role unmistakable; creative concept executed cleanly |
| **2** | **Rules, Constraints & Policy Alignment** | **15%** | ‚úÖ | Rules missing/contradictory; no policy/safety cues; no conflict handling | Clear rules for common cases; basic ‚Äúdo/don‚Äôt‚Äù; some gaps in edge cases or precedence | Unambiguous, prioritized rules with do/don‚Äôt lists, policy-aware refusals, and explicit conflict/edge-case handling |
| **3** | **Faithfulness & Constraint Adherence** | **20%** | ‚úÖ | Persona facts/rules frequently contradicted; visible drift | Mostly faithful; minor lapses under stress or odd inputs | Near-perfect adherence: rules & persona hold even under adversarial/off-domain inputs |
| **4** | **Effectiveness for Intended Use**<br>(domain or creative role) | **15%** | ‚úÖ | Persona harms usefulness (irrelevant, inaccurate, derailing) | Generally supports the intended role; outputs mostly relevant and correct | Clearly enhances intended use ‚Äî correctness for expert roles or immersive, on-brief roleplay |
| **5** | **Knowledge Limits & Uncertainty Handling** | **10%** | ‚úÖ | Overconfident; invents facts; no fallback | Sometimes admits uncertainty or asks clarifying questions | Consistently refuses or admits ignorance when appropriate; asks targeted clarifiers; avoids speculation |
| **6** | **Safety, Fairness, Inclusivity & Ethical Awareness** | **10%** | ‚úÖ | No guardrails; unsafe/bias-prone outputs likely | Some safety/fairness guidance; gaps remain | Strong refusal patterns, inclusive tone, bias mitigation, culturally sensitive phrasing; clear off-limits behaviors |
| **7** | **Adaptability, Robustness & Scalability** | **5%** |  | Breaks character under unusual or adversarial inputs | Holds for typical inputs; some failure at edges | Robust under diverse/adversarial inputs; persona + safety preserved across variations |
| **8** | **Format Specification, Examples & Efficiency** | **5%** |  | No output schema or examples; verbose or redundant | Some examples or format guidance; moderate clarity and efficiency | Clear schema/template; few-shot examples lock structure; concise and minimal redundancy |
