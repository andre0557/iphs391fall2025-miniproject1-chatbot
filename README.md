## 🚀 Overview  

This project is a **persona-driven chatbot** developed for **Kenyon College IPHS 391 (Fall 2025)**.  
It showcases prompt engineering, safety guardrails, and structured reasoning in a lightweight, modular chatbot system that can be run and inspected locally.  

Built using Python and a modular architecture, the chatbot demonstrates:

* **Persona consistency** through a carefully crafted system prompt (`persona_prompt.txt`)
* **Safe refusals** for harmful or irrelevant prompts
* **Clear, step-by-step reasoning** designed for an academic context
* **Ease of grading & reproducibility** with minimal setup requirements

## 👤 Persona Introduction: Dr. Adrian Kaleidos  

Meet **Dr. Adrian Kaleidos**, the heart of this project.  
Dr. Adrian is designed as a polymathic mentor — blending the curiosity of a teacher, the rigor of a scientist, and the warmth of a guide.  

**Backstory & Philosophy:**  
- **Education:** B.A. Applied Mathematics & CS (Cambridge), Ph.D. in Complex Systems (MIT Media Lab)  
- **Career:** Postdoc at CERN (particle interaction modeling), researcher at DeepMind (physics-inspired ML), now independent mentor  
- **Teaching Style:** Socratic — guiding learners with probing questions rather than simply giving answers  
- **Philosophy:** *"No single field has a monopoly on truth — the best insights come at the crossroads."*  

**Strengths & Flaws (for realism):**  
- ✅ Excellent at connecting ideas across disciplines  
- ✅ Encourages step-by-step reasoning and structured problem solving  
- ⚠️ Sometimes overexplains or makes leaps between concepts — but self-corrects quickly  

This persona is carefully crafted in `persona_prompt.txt` and drives the chatbot's tone, reasoning style, and interaction patterns.

## 🎯 Goals  

* **Persona Design** — Demonstrate a coherent, distinctive voice  
* **Reasoning Quality** — Provide step-by-step logical outputs and explanations  
* **Safety & Guardrails** — Handle unsafe or off-topic prompts gracefully  
* **Ease of Grading** — Make setup and interaction quick and reliable for graders  

---

## 🧠 How It Works  

The chatbot uses a **modular design** with a single entry point and clear separation of concerns:

* `persona_prompt.txt` — Defines the chatbot’s identity, rules, and tone  
* `chatbot.py` — Core logic for assembling prompts, calling the LLM, and formatting replies  
* `bot.py` — Orchestrates message flow between the user and the chatbot core  
* `app.py` — Entry point to run the chatbot (CLI or local server)  

Each reply follows a structured flow emphasizing:

* **Persona Voice** — Consistent tone and style  
* **Reasoning Transparency** — Step-by-step explanations to help users follow the logic  
* **Guardrails** — Refusal patterns to keep the bot safe and on-topic

## 🧪 Features  

* ✅ Persona-Driven Prompting — Coherent identity & voice  
* ✅ Guardrails & Safety — Safe refusals & fallback logic  
* ✅ Clear Reasoning — Step-by-step answers for clarity  
* ✅ Simple Local Demo — Run with a single Python command  
* ✅ Rubric-Ready — Designed to align with IPHS 391 grading (`rubric.md`)

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup  

> ⚠️ Make sure you have **Python 3.10+** installed and an API key for your LLM provider (OpenAI).

1. **Clone the repository:**

```

git clone [https://github.com/andre0557/iphs391fall2025-miniproject1-chatbot](https://github.com/andre0557/iphs391fall2025-miniproject1-chatbot)
cd iphs391fall2025-miniproject1-chatbot

```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**

```

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

4. **Configure API credentials:**

Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```

OPENAI\_API\_KEY=your\_api\_key\_here

```

5. **Run the chatbot:**

```

python app.py

```

## 📊 Future Roadmap  

* [ ] Add web UI (Streamlit or Flask front-end)  
* [ ] Support multiple personas with switchable prompts  
* [ ] Integrate RAG for knowledge-grounded responses  
* [ ] Add lightweight tests for prompt regression  
* [ ] Deploy to Render/Streamlit Cloud for demo

Would you like me to add a **short sample chat transcript** under the persona section so readers can see Dr. Adrian’s voice before they run the code? That can make the persona introduction even more compelling.
