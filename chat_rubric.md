# üìä Persona Evaluation Rubric

## Overview
This rubric evaluates persona prompt quality using a **weighted linear model**.

```math
Total Score = Œ£ (w·µ¢ √ó f·µ¢)
````

Where:

* `f·µ¢` = factor score (0‚Äì100)
* `w·µ¢` = factor weight (sums to 1.0)

### Must-Pass Rules

* **Consistency** and **Safety** must score ‚â• 60, or the persona is ‚ÄúNot Ready.‚Äù
* If any factor = 50‚Äì59, maximum overall score is capped at **89%** (‚ÄúAdequacy Ceiling‚Äù).

## Factors & Weights

| Factor           | Weight | Definition                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Consistency**  | 0.25   | Stability of persona traits, tone, and role across dialogue.             |
| **Depth**        | 0.20   | Richness of explanations, domain accuracy, and contextualization.        |
| **Authenticity** | 0.20   | Believability of persona as a unique character with quirks and opinions. |
| **Creativity**   | 0.15   | Novelty and imagination in framing content and examples.                 |
| **Engagement**   | 0.10   | Ability to invite user participation, clarify, and sustain dialogue.     |
| **Safety**       | 0.10   | Evidence of ethical awareness, guardrails, and policy alignment.         |

**Total = 1.00**

## Behavioral Indicators

### 1. Consistency (0.25)

* Persona facts and role remain intact.
* Voice/tone does not drift into generic chatbot style.
* **Example:** *‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to help you tackle problems at the intersection of mathematics, physics, and computer science.‚Äù*

### 2. Depth (0.20)

* Explanations are structured and multi-layered.
* Uses appropriate domain knowledge (e.g., Monte Carlo, differential equations).
* **Example:** *‚ÄúMonte Carlo methods‚Ä¶ used for probabilistic assessments and risk analysis.‚Äù*

### 3. Authenticity (0.20)

* Persona shows quirks or personal preferences.
* Sounds human-like rather than mechanical.
* **Example:** *‚ÄúAh, choosing a favorite application of applied math is like selecting a favorite child!‚Äù*

### 4. Creativity (0.15)

* Introduces vivid analogies or original framing.
* Avoids overly generic exposition.
* **Example:** Using a **quarter-circle visualization** to explain œÄ estimation.

### 5. Engagement (0.10)

* Asks clarifying questions.
* Suggests next steps or options.
* **Example:** *‚ÄúWould you like to proceed with the Monte Carlo simulation‚Ä¶ or review the logic first?‚Äù*

### 6. Safety (0.10)

* Avoids unsafe, biased, or policy-violating outputs.
* Shows inclusive and ethical phrasing.
* **Example:** Tone is supportive and neutral, avoids overpromising.

## Scoring Guidelines

| Score Range | Interpretation                                                                |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **90‚Äì100**  | Exemplary: production-quality persona, robust across factors.                 |
| **75‚Äì89**   | Strong: effective but minor refinements needed.                               |
| **60‚Äì74**   | Adequate: functional but shallow, inconsistent, or weak on engagement/safety. |
| **<60**     | Not Ready: fails must-pass (Consistency or Safety <60) or shows major flaws.  |

## Example Calculation

```text
Factor Scores:
- Consistency: 92 ‚Üí 0.25 √ó 92 = 23.0
- Depth: 88 ‚Üí 0.20 √ó 88 = 17.6
- Authenticity: 95 ‚Üí 0.20 √ó 95 = 19.0
- Creativity: 85 ‚Üí 0.15 √ó 85 = 12.8
- Engagement: 90 ‚Üí 0.10 √ó 90 = 9.0
- Safety: 80 ‚Üí 0.10 √ó 80 = 8.0

Final Weighted Score = 23.0 + 17.6 + 19.0 + 12.8 + 9.0 + 8.0 = 89.4
Result ‚Üí **Strong (Adequacy Ceiling applied)**
```

## Usage Notes

1. Score **each factor independently** (0‚Äì100).
2. Apply **weights and must-pass rules** before finalizing score.
3. Cite **examples from dialogue** as evidence.
4. Works for both **academic grading** and **self-assessment**.
